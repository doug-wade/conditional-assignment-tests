# conditional assignment tests

Reference tests for conditional assignment operator implementations

# running the tests with babel

The tests assume you have a babel that supports conditional assignment as peer directories to this directory.  For example, clone https://github.com/doug-wade/babylon and https://github.com/doug-wade/babel as peer dependencies.  The install the dependencies with `npm install` and run the tests with  `npm test`.
